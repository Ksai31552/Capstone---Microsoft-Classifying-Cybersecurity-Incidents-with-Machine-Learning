# Microsoft Capstone: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning
Need to train the model using the train dataset and provide evaluation metrics—macro-F1 score, precision, and recall—based on the model's performance on the test dataset. This ensures that the model is not only well-trained but also generalizes effectively to unseen data, making it reliable for real-world applications.
